========

Place for putting some xml related coding experience.

Currently. it contains
- XMLTokenIterator: An iterator that can iterate over an XML document to extract 
  a series of elements matched by the specified path expression. The patch expression
  is similar to an xpath expression. However it differs from xpath, in which the path
  may consist of a series of QNames and a unix-like wildcard can be used for the QNames.
